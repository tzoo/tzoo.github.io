In the land of bytes and screens so bright,  
Where algorithms work both day and night,  
Lurks a shadow, hidden from sight,  
Threats to security, ready to bite.

Models vast with wisdom grand,  
Yet risks in their depths are close at hand,  
A wrong prompt can lead to harm,  
Or spread falsehoods with alarming charm.

Secrets may leak, or data be traced,  
In the web where privacy’s erased,  
Be cautious of errors and tricks unseen,  
Guard your data, keep it clean.

From phishing scams to advice untrue,  
Be aware of what the models do,  
Secure your code and watch the gate,  
For in AI’s world, risks are great.
